# N-Body Simulation

This is a [N-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) I wrote in javascript.  
I'm currently busy with school work & this will be put on hold for quite a while.  
  
The aim is to write an accessible, interactive, and reasonably accurate simulation which anyone can play with to investigate various scientific principles. It currently models only Brownian motion, but should eventually be able to model things like the formation of galaxies.  

## How to Use
 1. Clone the whole repository (HTML, js & css files)
 2. Open the html file with a web browser
 3. Done!!! 

## Implemented
 * Grid-based collision detection
 * Elastic collisions b/w bodies
 * Resizeable window

## To be Implemented
 * Variable time-steps
 * Gravitational/Electrostatic Forces (Particle Mesh, P2M?)
 * Magnetic fields from moving charges???
 * Friction???
 * Control panel to tweak velocity, mass, charge, body size, etc.
 * A body/gravitational force which follows cursor? Triggered by click?
 * Coloured balls?
 * Random body sizes???
